## Motivation
We are developing a SAT solver from scratch based on the DPLL algorithm. The
purpose of this project is to explore the Boolean Satisfiability Problem,
complexity, programming languages and optimization techniques. This project
began in June 2020 as a summer research project facilitated by the Leadership
Alliance and will be developed over time.

Future development goals include:
* Improving runtime consistency across benchmarks
* Implementing optimizations such as conflict clause learning
* Exploring literal selection heuristics
* Improving argument handling and program structure
* Reimplementation of a SAT Solver in a lower-level language 

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3.6.9
* Linux Shell Script

Some benchmarks were created with:
* [cnfgen](https://massimolauria.net/cnfgen/) by Massimo Lauria and contributors

## Setup
TL;DR: Use this command from the central folder to get things going:
`python3 code/solver.py [filename]`

This project requires Python3. Feel free to clone this repository onto your system if 
you would like to experiment with the code. The [code](code) directory has much more 
information about how to compile and run the program.

## Status
This project is actively being developed. If you have any inquires about our
work feel free to send an e-mail to Ashley.

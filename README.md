## Motivation
We are developing a SAT solver from scratch based on the DPLL algorithm. The
purpose of this project is to explore the Boolean Satisfiability Problem,
complexity, programming languages and optimization techniques. This project
began in June 2020 as a summer research project facilitated by the Leadership
Alliance and will be developed over time.

Future development goals include:
* Improving runtime consistency across benchmarks
* Implementing optimizations such as conflict clause learning
* Exploring literal selection heuristics
* Improving argument handling and program structure

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3.6.9
* Linux Shell Script

Some benchmarks were created with:
* [cnfgen](https://massimolauria.net/cnfgen/) by Massimo Lauria and contributors

## Setup
This project requires Python3. *This section is still under construction.*

## Solving Process
*This section is still under construction.*

## Status
This project is actively being developed. If you have any inquires about our
work feel free to send an e-mail to Ashley.
